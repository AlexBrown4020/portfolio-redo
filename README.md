# Portfolio Project

# Overview

For this project you must create the beginnings of a personal portfolio page using Vanilla **HTML JS** & **CSS.** Beyond creating a portfolio page, this project will be a good opportunity to practice

- [ ]  Responsive Web Design
- [ ]  Accessibility
- [ ]  Semantic HTML Tags
- [ ]  CSS & HTML

## Why HTML JS & CSS?

Most portfolio websites are often single page **static web pages** with information about the person who owns the website, maybe some projects that they have worked on, 

## Can I use a framework (react, vue, angular, gatsby, etc?)

The short answer: No.
The reason is this is; while you definitely could, you may be over-engineering the problem. You should not need a framework in order to implement a basic portfolio project as you do not need to manage complex user input and user interactivity features.

## What's Netlify?

Netlify is an open source web hosting tool that makes deploying your projects fast and easy. Typically you will need to give a deployment website some build command however since we are just making an HTML CSS static site, you also will not necessarily need a build tool like web pack

## Node? Express?

Because of the relative simplicity of this project, we do not necessarily need node and express to create a development environment. 

## Basic Requirements

### Set-up

- [ ]  Fork this repository.
- [ ]  Clone this repository to your desktop.
- [ ]  Within your application you will need to create both an `index.html` & an `style.css`. Netlify looks for the `index.html` file when searching what file it needs to serve.
- [ ]  Create an account on **netlify.com**

### Static Web Page
- [ ]  It should include a photo of yourself.
- [ ]  It should have a small area some where that talks a little bit about who you are.
- [ ]  Consider including references to projects you have built or will work on.
- [ ]  Consider having a link to your resume, social media, and github.
- [ ]  Use semantic HTML tags.
- [ ]  Web page must be responsive (does it look good on different devices?).
- [ ]  Choose a color scheme with reasonable contrast. Bonus points if you have checked it against how people with sight impairment may see it.

### Deployment

- [ ]  Must be deployed to **Netlify.**

### Presentation

- [ ]  Presentations will be 5 minutes **maximum**. Within this, include:
    - [ ]  Must include a demonstration, include website's responsiveness
    - [ ]  Must include a google slide presentation. Use this as a space to talk about learnings, challenges & anything else unique about your project.
- [ ]  Take time to polish up your slides so that there is consistency between your application and your slides.
